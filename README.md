SUBMISSION:

"The Color Purple" Time Capsule:

This tree symbolically represents Celie at the beginning of the novel. She is abused so much by her father that she learned to cope with it by pretending she cannot feel anything: “I make myself wood. I say to myself, Celie, you a tree” (Walker 60). Once she gets married, she also states that this woodenness that she developed prevents her from feeling any love for Mr. ____’s children: “I don’t feel nothing for them. Patting Harpo … more like patting another piece of wood” (Walker 69).

This book symbolically represents Celie’s younger sister, Nettie. From a young age, she was very intelligent and loved to read. She would share everything that she learned at school with Celie while Celie had to stay home because her father made her pregnant. Celie knew how much Nettie loved to learn, so she convinced her father to marry Celie off to Mr. ____ instead of Nettie, so Nettie could continue doing what she loved: “I ast him to take me instead of Nettie … I tell Nettie to keep at her books” (Walker 34).

This frog symbolically represents Mr. ____, the man Celie was unwillingly married off to, at the end of the novel. He used to frequently abuse Celie and treat her like a servant. However, when Celie left him, he transformed himself into a much better person who now respects women and regrets what he did to Celie. He even asked her to marry him again, but “this time in the spirit as well as in the flesh” (Walker 363). However, Celie declines because she doesn’t like men; she says “men look like frogs to me” (Walker 328). Instead of being offended by this, he finds it funny. He carves a small purple frog for her that she keeps in her room, which shows how much he has changed, because that is definitely not something he would have done while they were married.

This button is one of the items that represents the thematic idea of the novel: empowerment. From a young age, Celie was being abused by her father, and by Mr. ____ when she got married. When she met Shug, she learned that she could enjoy her body on her own terms. Shug showed her a “button” that she could use. This was an important step towards Celie’s self empowerment, because now she could be the one in control rather than the men who had just been using her.

This purple flower also represents Celie’s empowerment. Celie used to believe that God was an old white bearded man, which is the traditional image. However, Shug introduced her to a new idea; according to her, “God is everything … Everything that is or ever was or ever will be” (Walker 260). This realization has a huge impact on Celie; she states that now that she’s not so worried about what God will think, she’s able to enjoy her life more: “I been so busy thinking bout [that old white man] I never truly notice nothing God make. … Now that my eyes opening, I feels like a fool” (Walker 261). One of the things she is able to enjoy now is the color of the purple flowers in the field near her house, which she was never able to appreciate before. This religious awakening was an important step towards Celie’s empowerment because the world no longer seems so male-dominated to her. 

This pair of pants is another symbol of Celie’s empowerment, which is the thematic idea of the novel. During this time period, it was not as common for women to wear pants. When Shug first suggests that Celie should try making a pair, she replies, “What do I need pants for? I ain’t no man. … Mr. ____ not going to let his wife wear pants” (Walker 204). However, she does eventually make a pair, and falls in love with pants. Not only does wearing pants, which were thought of as masculine, make her feel less afraid of men, they also lead to Celie becoming self-sufficient. She learns that she enjoys making pants so much that she turns it into a successful business. Now that she earns her own money, she is finally free from the controlling men in her life; pants led to the final step of Celie’s journey to self empowerment.

This letter relates to the plot of The Color Purple. Letters are extremely important to the story; the whole novel is made up of letters that Celie writes to God and to her sister Nettie, and letters that Nettie writes to Celie. For Celie, writing letters gives her purpose. She begins writing them because her father tells Celie not to tell anybody except God what he is doing to her: “You better not never tell nobody but God” (Walker 28). Celie takes this literally and addresses her letters with “Dear God”. Since then, she continues to write letters to express herself, and gains strength through them. Also, when Celie first received one of Nettie’s letters, it was a huge turning point in her life. She previously thought her sister and her children were dead, but now that she knows they are all alive and happy, Celie has hope for their future together. This is part of what inspires her to finally leave her abusive husband and create a better life for herself. She wrote, “Now I know Nettie alive I begin to strut a little bit. … When she come home us leave here. Her and me and our two children” (Walker 206).

This leaf represents the roofleaf used by the African people that Nettie meets. When Nettie travels to Africa, she stays in a village of people known as the Olinka, and learns that they have a story behind their “roofleaf”—the leaves that they use to make the roofs of their huts. Many years ago, the village had a greedy chief who took the roofleaf for granted. He used the land where the roofleaf grew to cultivate crops, so he could trade them for money. Eventually, there was no roofleaf left, and when the rainy season arrived, the people had nothing to protect themselves with. Half the village was wiped out. It took five years for the roofleaf to grow back, and once all the villagers had roofs again, they all celebrated. From then on, they have been worshipping the roofleaf. A villager told Nettie, “we know a roofleaf is not Jesus Christ, but in its own humble way, is it not God?” (Walker 213). This relates to Celie’s realization about God earlier in the story: she doesn’t need to view God in the traditional way (an old white man). Her idea of God can be anything she wants.

This quilt is another item that is important to the plot of the novel. It is a symbol of peace and unity for the characters. For example, after Sofia got mad at Celie for telling Sofia’s husband that he should beat her, they made up by creating a quilt together. Celie and Shug also created a quilt together, made out of Celie’s old fabric scraps and parts of one of Shug’s old dresses. As they sew their individual pieces together, it symbolizes their relationship with each other. Once the quilt is finished, Shug says, “Us each other’s peoples now” (Walker 247).

This toy road represents the road that was built through the Olinka village. The Olinka people were originally excited to hear that a road was being built near their village because it would make travel outside of the village easier: “the roadbuilders talked much of how quickly the Olinka will now be able to get to the coast” (Walker 230). However, once they found out that the plan was for the road to cut directly through the village, they became distressed, because there was nothing they could do about it. They had to sit by and watch their homes, crops, church and school all get destroyed in less than a day. The Olinka people also discovered that their village was now owned by a rubber manufacturer in England. They tried everything they could to get their land back, but none of the white people took them seriously. In this way, the road is a symbol for the oppression of black people by white people.
